# Brand

Brand identity, voice, messaging, asset management, and consistency frameworks.

## When to Use

- Brand voice definition and content tone guidance
- Visual identity standards and style guide development
- Messaging framework creation
- Brand consistency review and audit
- Asset organization, naming, and approval
- Color palette management and typography specs

## Script Paths

Paths in this skill and its references are relative to the directory containing the loaded `SKILL.md`. Resolve local `scripts/`, `references/`, and `templates/` paths from that directory, using the skill location supplied by the runtime. Invoke scripts with quoted absolute paths while keeping the working directory at the project root; project inputs and outputs such as `docs/brand-guidelines.md`, `assets/design-tokens.json`, and `src/` remain project-relative.

A command written as `../<skill>/scripts/<file>` refers to another skill. Use the adjacent folder when it exists; otherwise resolve that skill by name through the runtime's available skill catalog and use its actual script path. Separately imported skills may live in unrelated directories. If a required skill or tool is unavailable, report the missing dependency instead of guessing a path.

## Quick Start

**Inject brand context into prompts:**
```bash
node scripts/inject-brand-context.cjs
node scripts/inject-brand-context.cjs --json
```

**Validate an asset:**
```bash
node scripts/validate-asset.cjs <asset-path>
```

**Extract/compare colors:**
```bash
node scripts/extract-colors.cjs --palette
node scripts/extract-colors.cjs <image-path>
```

## Brand Sync Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit docs/brand-guidelines.md (or ask the brand skill to update it)
# 2. Sync to design tokens
node scripts/sync-brand-to-tokens.cjs
# 3. Verify
node scripts/inject-brand-context.cjs --json | head -20
```

The sync stops when it detects existing token files, `:root` custom properties
or Tailwind v4 `@theme` variables in common CSS entry points and their local
CSS imports, or Tailwind theme colors and presets. Review the reported source
before proceeding. If the detected files are the managed
`assets/design-tokens.*` outputs from an earlier sync and replacing them is
intentional, re-run with `--force`.

When `brand` and `design-system` are installed separately, resolve
`design-system` from the runtime's skill catalog and pass the absolute path to
its `scripts/generate-tokens.cjs` with `--generator`:

```bash
node scripts/sync-brand-to-tokens.cjs --generator "<absolute-path-to-generate-tokens.cjs>"
```

The adjacent `design-system` folder remains the default for a bundled install.

**Files synced:**
- `docs/brand-guidelines.md` → Source of truth
- `assets/design-tokens.json` → Token definitions
- `assets/design-tokens.css` → CSS variables

## Routing

1. Determine the requested operation from the user request. Use `$ARGUMENTS` only if the runtime supplies it; otherwise use the task text directly.
2. Load the corresponding reference listed in Subcommands.
3. Execute with the supplied context; ask only for missing information needed for the task.
